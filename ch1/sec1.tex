\section{Na√Øvely}\label{sec:1.1}

\begin{note}
  We introduced two separate types of things to worry about.
  First, there are the mathematical models, which you can think of as the mathematical worlds, or constructs.
  Then there are axioms.
  It seems that we have to be able to look at some symbols in a particular formal language and then take those symbols and relate them in some way to a mathematical structure.
  Different interpretations of the symbols will lead to different conclusions as regards the truth of the formal statement.

  Our next objectives are to introduce formal languages, to give an official definition of a mathematical structure, and to discuss truth in those structures.
  Beauty will come later.
